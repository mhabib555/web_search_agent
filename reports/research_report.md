# Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Laravel: Improving Page Load Times

## Introduction

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique where the application's HTML is generated on the server, rather than in the browser. This approach offers several benefits, most notably improved SEO and faster initial load times, leading to better performance, especially on devices with limited resources. This report summarizes how SSR with Laravel improves website page load times.

## How SSR with Laravel Works

Implementing SSR in Laravel often involves utilizing a package like V8Js to execute JavaScript code on the server. The general process includes the following steps:

1.  **Install V8Js:**  Install the V8Js extension for PHP.
2.  **Create a JavaScript file:** Create a JavaScript file containing the code to render the application. This file will be executed on the server using V8Js.
3.  **Create a Laravel route:** Create a Laravel route to handle the SSR request. This route will execute the JavaScript code and return the rendered HTML.
4.  **Update your view:** Update the view to use the rendered HTML from the server.

## Benefits for Page Load Times

SSR with Laravel can significantly improve the *initial* page load time. Instead of the browser waiting for JavaScript to download and execute to render the page, the server sends fully rendered HTML. This leads to a faster "first contentful paint," enhancing the user experience, particularly for users with slow internet connections or less powerful devices. Furthermore, it reduces client-side processing, shifting the rendering burden to the server.

## Conclusion

By pre-rendering HTML on the server, SSR with Laravel offers a tangible improvement in page load times, leading to a better user experience and improved SEO.
